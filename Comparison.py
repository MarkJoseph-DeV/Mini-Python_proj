# This pratice is for documentation only...
# This code compares two lists and checks if they are equal.
# If they are equal, it prints the type of the lists; otherwise, it prompts to try again.
# The lists are defined as tuples of strings.
# The function `compare_lists` takes two arguments and compares them.


x = ('mark,john,paul,ringo') # Define the first list as a tuple of strings
y = ('john,paul,ringo,mark')

def compare_lists(x, y): #Arrgumentary Sample Code...
    
    if x == y():    # Compare the two lists
        print(type(x and y))
    else:
        print("Try Again")
        
        #calling the function
